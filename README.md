# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project 🚀

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!  

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a two-layer SQL Data Warehouse (Bronze & Silver) for a digital subscription business operating multiple acquisition channels. The repository showcases the full analytics workflow from raw data ingestion to exploratory data analysis (EDA), providing actionable insights to inform marketing, retention, and revenue strategies.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Warehouse Architecture**
  - Bronze layer: raw data ingestion from CSVs

- **Data Sources**
 - Customer records, transactions, marketing campaigns, and activity logs from CRM
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
  - Standardization of acquisition channels
  - Duplicate removal
