# DataWarehouse-and-Customer-Analytics
## Data Warehouse & Analytics Project 🚀

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!  

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a two-layer SQL Data Warehouse (Bronze & Silver) for a digital subscription business operating multiple acquisition channels. The repository showcases the full analytics workflow from raw data ingestion to exploratory data analysis (EDA), providing actionable insights to inform marketing, retention, and revenue strategies.
 # 🏗️ Data Architecture

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization,normalization processes to prepare data for analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis.
